// This script is intentionally left blank. 
// The Firebase configuration and initialization logic has been moved directly into
// the <script> tag at the bottom of index.html.
// This simplifies the setup for users, as they only need to edit one file (index.html)
// to configure the public tracking page, rather than two.
// This file is kept to prevent 404 errors if it's referenced by old cache.
